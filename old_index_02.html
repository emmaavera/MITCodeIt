            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3>PARENTS</h3>
                <h6>When is it?</h6> 
                The program meets weekly, on Saturday afternoons from 11am to 3pm. The Fall 2017 session will begin on October 7 and end on December 2. We will not meet on November 25. This is a total of 8 sessions (10/7, 10/14, 10/21, 10/28, 11/4, 11/11, 11/18, and 12/2).

                <h6>How much money does it cost?</h6> 
                The program will be free of charge. We have computers and smartphones for students to use and will provide catered lunch each day. 

                <h6>Do the students receive a certificate upon completion of the program?</h6> 
                Students will receive a symbolic certificate associated with the program. Note that the certificate is awarded by the program, and not on behalf of MIT.

                <h6>Where is the program and where will the students be?</h6> 
                The program is at MIT. Our activities will be in MIT classrooms or MIT outdoor spaces.

                <h6>What will the schedule be?</h6> 
                Each session will include coding activities, social activities, demonstrations, and a lunch break.

                <h6>Where should kids be dropped off and picked up?</h6> 
                Kids should be dropped off by 10:50am and picked up at 3:10pm. Exact drop-off and pick-up locations will be communicated via email upon acceptance to the program.

                <h6>Who is organizing this program?</h6> 
                MIT students.

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3>STUDENTS</h3>
                <h6>Can boys participate?</h6> 
                The program is intended to help decrease the gender-gap in technology, so it is not open to boys.

                <h6>What programming experience do I need to participate?</h6> 
                Zero! We want to introduce you to programming, and do not expect you to have any previous programming experience.

                <h6>If I have coded before, can I still participate?</h6> 
                We are first-and-foremost opening the program to students with no prior experience. However, if there are open spots, we welcome you to participate!

                <h6>I'm a 9th grade student. Can I still apply?</h6> 
                Unfortunately, we won't be accepting applications from 9th grade students. Please feel free to instead check out high school outreach programs <a href="https://swe.mit.edu/outreach/high_school/">here</a>!

                <h6>How can I prepare for the program?</h6> 
                If you are curious to learn more about programming, feel free to play around with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>! However, we don't require you to do any preparation ahead of time.

                <h6>I'm interested, but won't be able to make all of the sessions. Can I still apply?</h6> 
                We give heavy preference to girls who can commit to all of our class sessions, but we still encourage you to apply! We can make arrangements to send supplementary materials to make up for the missed class(es), if need be.
